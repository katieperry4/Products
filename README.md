# Products
This project is just me messing around with custom components and classes. As well as some form validation in the 'form validation' branch.



## Description
This branch is the base project before the addition of the form validation section. It's a dummy site to practice HTML, CSS, and JS. I do recommend checking out the other branch

## Technology

HTML, 
CSS, 
Vanilla JS

## Roadmap
I want to make it look more like a real site so I have more experience in building this type of thing. It also needs the published form data to look better than it currently does.
